Welcome to Fermat! 
-------------------

Fermat is an open-source P2P digital wallet platform that runs on multiple OS including Android, Linux, iOS, OSX and Windows.

What makes Fermat different from other wallet platforms or services?

* **Fermat is P2P.** That makes it censorship resistent and difficult to be attacked.

* **Fermat runs on end users' devices.** That enables users to hold their own money eliminating the need to trust a third party. 

* **Fermat segments the world population and brings a custom tailored solution for each segment.** Any developer can create niche wallets for a particular group of people. Brands can easily create their own wallet for their followers.

* **Fermat uses crypto currency networks as public value transport networks.** Fermat users cant choose to move their money arround the world easily and almost for free via these public value transport networks or the legacy financial system networks as well. 

* **Fermat guaratees plugins and wallet developers a revenue stream.** Fermat implements an innovative business model which allows plugins and wallet developers to define a use license, and Fermat itself enforces this license on behalf of developers. 

Fermat is moving towards version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[documentation](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/fermat-documentation) that we're anxious to add. 
So take Fermat out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite platform to launch your digital wallet.
